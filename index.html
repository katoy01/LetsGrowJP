          <p>Story</p>
          <p>You play as a farmer who gained their dying grandfather’s farmland to grow crops and gather produce from animals. You are given a minimal amount of seeds to start and will have to develop as a farmer to gain more seeds and more farmland. You also run a restaurant where you can serve dishes using the crops harvested. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p> Instructions</p>
          <p>Player movement: WASD<br/>
            Interact button: ‘ENTER’ (note: you can interact with gates, farmland, animals, NPCs, & doors)<br/>
            Inventory: Number buttons 1-8<br/>
            Store: Number buttons 1-3<br/>
            Kitchen Inventory: Number buttons 1-5
          </p>  
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Details:</p>
          <p>You can move the player using WASD keys, moving up, left, down and right respectively.
             To enter the farm plots, you must click “enter” when your player 
            is facing and touching the gate which changes the tile to an open gate that allows the player to pass.<br/>
            <br/>
            Farming: <br/>
            When you are in the farm plots you can press “enter” when your player is facing and touching 
            a dirt tile to enter the player’s inventory. In the player’s inventory, you will see the three 
            seeds the player has access to: corn, wheat, and tomatoes, as well as milk and eggs which are 
            collected from the animals. You select what inventory object you want to use by pressing a number 
            key 1-8. With a seed selected, you can plant it by clicking the mouse, which will lead you back 
            to the farm world with the crop planted in front of you. This action will remove 1 seed from your
             inventory. To harvest crops,  you press “enter” which will add 1 crop to your inventory. This can be 
             seen in the bar at the bottom of the screen. When you are done farming, you can leave through the gate, 
             pressing “enter” to close it behind you. <br/>
             <br/>
             Animals:<br/>
            To interact with the animals, press “enter,” which will make them look towards your direction if 
            you are facing it. Interacting with an adult cow will add one milk to your inventory, and the same 
            is true for the adult chicken which will add one egg. The player can interact with the calf and chick
             within the pen, but you will get no milk or eggs from them.<br/>
             <br/>
             Store:<br/>
             When facing and touching the door to the store, press “enter” and the store interface will display. Select a 
             number key 1-3, press “enter” and 1 item will be added to your inventory that is shown when planting crops.<br/>
             <br/>
             Restaurant:<br/>
             To enter the restaurant, press “enter” when facing the door. Once inside, you can interact with the recipe book
              by pressing “enter” and then clicking on the displayed arrows to look through them all. To close the recipe book press “esc”. 
              Walk to pot and press “enter,” and you can select between ingredients to create the final recipe. For example, to create “bruschetta”, 
              add 1 tomato and 1 wheat and then click the mouse to start cooking. To clear selection, such as if you selected the wrong ingredients, 
              press “esc” and then press “enter” in front of pot. Once it is done press “enter” and the dish will be on top of the player’s head. 
              You can press “enter” when in front of the customer to serve them the food. To exit the restaurant, go to door and press “enter”.<br/>
              <br/>
              NPC:<br/>
              Villager NPC’s move from one location to another by using the A-star algorithm and the world grid. NPC’s are interactable,
              where if the player presses “enter” in front of them they will stop to look at the player, before resuming their walking. 
              The player can also stop NPC’s from moving by placing themself in front of them.<br/>
              Customer NPC’s always spawn in the entrance of the restaurant and path to either table, 
              and to either seat randomly. Occupied tables are kept track of so that no two customers sit in the same seat. 
              The player can interact with them in the kitchen as well. The customer will ‘order’ after the are seated by displaying a speech bubble of the food that they want.
