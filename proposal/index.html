    <p style="width:1200px;">For this midterm project we (Yoshiaki Kato Ton√© Nanna) will be working to design a farming and restaurant simulator where the playable character is a farmer who aspires to get 3 Michelin stars at their restaurant. You start off with a sum of money that your parent gave you as a parting gift, which then can be used to buy farming equipment to set up the restaurant. This is done at the store, which you can access through a door inside the restaurant. You will start with only basic ingredients that you can buy at the store such as wheat, animals, and other seeds. You can plant seeds at your farm plot, and when you buy animals it will create an animal pen at your farm where you can collect animal products (eg. eggs, milk). These items will take a specific amount of time before they are ready to be collected, and will be stored inside your inventory. Over time new ingredients and farm plots can be unlocked. Time passes using days, with the game starting on Day 1. This value will be stored in localStorage so players can resume where they left off. </p>
    <p style="width:1200px;">With the materials in your inventory, you can start working on your restaurant. To go to the restaurant there will be a door that the character can go through, which will then change the map to the restaurant map. You get to decide when your working hours begin, but time will still progress. There are certain time slots that will have more of an abundance of customers, and some time slots will have only a few customers (idea: there will be less customers at morning and night, but there will be a lot of customers at noon). At your restaurant kitchen you can cook by selecting an item from your inventory and adding it to the pot or pan. There will be specific recipes that require specific ingredients that you can only get after you progress the game. There will also be customers on one side of the restaurant kitchen that line up, and you will receive one order at a time to complete them. There will be a customer satisfaction/ anger meter variable where if you take too much time or are not able to complete the order due to scarcity of ingredients, you will lose Reputation Points (RP). With enough RP, you can gain a Michelin Star. It will be increasingly difficult to make recipes and satisfy customers. If you lose too much RP, your reputation will go negative and regress your progress and lose a Star. Your RP will be stored in local storage. </p>
